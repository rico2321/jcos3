Ive been pushing myself hard lately, balancing college with basketball practice, but it felt like college life was always one step ahead of me. Classes were challenging, assignments seemed endless, and sleep was becoming rare. It wasn’t easy, and sometimes, it felt like the weight of it all was getting a bit too heavy.
Ian, my close friend and sparring partner, noticed the shift. One afternoon, as we both gearing up in the gym to spar, he gave me a look that said he’d seen enough of the stress written on my face.
As we did light sparring for over 2 rounds, he stopped to ask if I was okay, that's pretty much his character. I told him about about this "College Life" and that it sucks. He shrugged and said "Well, that's life.
Sometimes we may not have it our own way, but we must make do with whatever oportunity we have. Yes it sucks, but we must move on." At a glimpse moment, I figured he was right.
